            <p>For each session of the bootcamp you will need to bring:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your course materials.</strong> Your course book and information should be mailed to you before the course. If you do not receive your book three days prior to class please email me at <a href="mailto:pauline@casemanagementbootcamp.com">pauline@casemanagementbootcamp.com</a> so I can make sure you receive the needed materials for the course.</li>
                <li><strong>Your full attention.</strong> That means you'll want to remove any distractions ahead of time, so make sure you're in a quiet space, turn off your phone, and tell anyone in the area that you're going to be studying for the next several hours.</li>
                <li><strong>A way to take notes.</strong> That could be on your computer, but if you learn better when you take notes by hand, please be sure you have access to a notebook, pen, and highlighters as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Water and snacks.</strong> While we will have a break for lunch and the bathroom, I want you to have everything you need to stay sharp and focused. And that means staying hydrated as well as having something on hand in case of low blood sugar.</li>
                <li><strong>A learner's mindset.</strong> As professionals we can occassionally think to ourselves “I know this already.” I want you to come to this class with the open mind that you can always refresh or enhance what you may already know.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This Bootcamp is a continuing education platform designed for nurses, social workers, and other healthcare professionals to expand and enhance their knowledge and clinical skills in health care case management.</p>
